# Subdomain Enumeration Tool

`subenum.py` is a high-speed, asynchronous subdomain enumeration tool that uses **async DNS resolution** and integrates with multiple APIs for passive subdomain discovery.  
It is designed to minimize duplicate results and optionally filter subdomains based on their resolved IP addresses.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Asynchronous DNS Resolution**  
  Uses `aiodns` with **Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 & 1.0.0.1)** for fast, concurrent subdomain resolution.

- 📜 **Wordlist-Based Bruteforce**  
  Supports custom subdomain wordlists for brute-force enumeration.

- 🌐 **Passive API-Based Enumeration** *(Optional)*  
  Fetches subdomains from:
  - 🧪 VirusTotal API
  - 🔍 SecurityTrails API
  - 🛡 AlienVault OTX API

- 🗂 **Duplicate Filtering** *(Default)*  
  - Filters subdomains that resolve to the same IP set (default mode).
  - Option to **disable filtering** (`-df`) to reveal virtual hosts and multiple subdomains pointing to the same IP.

- 🛰 **Private/Public IP Detection**  
  Automatically labels resolved IPs as **Public** or **Private**.

- ♻ **Global Deduplication**  
  Ensures unique subdomain names across both **wordlist** and **API results**.

- 💾 **Customizable Output**  
  - Save results in **TXT** format (`-oT`)
  - Save results in **JSON** format (`-oJ`)
  - Includes subdomain → IP mapping and scan metadata.

- 🔑 **Environment File Auto-Creation**  
  - Automatically creates `~/.env` with placeholders for API keys if missing.
  - API keys are loaded securely from `.env`.
